# Member

In order for a User to communicate through a Conversation they must join the Conversation through membership.

Member objects connect Users with Conversations. When a User joins a Conversation a Member object has to be created. Each Member object has one Conversation and one User associated with it.

A User can be associated with many Member objects in Conversations, just as a Conversation can have many Members.

A Member can have various states such as `invited`, `joined` and `left`.

A Member object has one associated Channel, so one User can have many Member objects associated with it, according to the Channels that they can be reached through.

Each Member has a unique Member ID of the form:

```
MEM-df8e57d8-1c8e-4573-bf4d-29d5414dcb42
```

Memberships can be created in various ways: via the Conversation API, using the functions provided by the Comms SDKs, or using the command line.
